This program runs a single hidden-layer neural network that will learn to 
classify handwritten characters. The program will run and ask you to set the parameters
for the network. For the program to run properly, compile and run with the letters
dataset "ANN-Letter-Data.csv" in the program's working directory. The network will
then train on the dataset, execute a validation test, and display its learning throughout 
the epochs, and a confusion matrix for its validation test. 

Optimal parameters for this network are:
Learning Rate: 0.01
Mini-batch Size: 250
Hidden Layer Size: 52
Desired Error: 10%
